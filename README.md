Demo [here](https://aestheticize.herokuapp.com/).


### Aestheticize is, in theory, a dynamically generated social media application designed around exploring one's tastes and comparing them to others. Aestheticize is a portmanteau of Aestheticcs and Synthesize - our goal is to generate your aesthetics, and match them with other similar users.
-- Aestheticize is my third project for the KU Coding Bootcamp

-- Aestheticize is currently in very early production, thus some features are unavailable. They'll be coming soon.

## Current Features
#### Account Creation

Account creation is simple. Just enter the required data and Aestheticize will get to work. Currently, only the user's favorite music is generated with their account, but other information will be used in the future.

#### Logging In

Logging in is currently handled by the database. An authentecation system via Passport.js is currently coded but not fully functional.

#### Personal Feed

User profiles are currently very basic, but will be incorporated in to the connections features in the near future.

## Upcoming features

#### Connections

Connections in aestheticize are more than just friends - they're people who share interests. In the future, we will be able to display people with similar tastes to you, so that you can find friends or new interests through them.


#### Expanded aesthetic synthesis 

Right now, our features are only applicable to music, but we plan on integrating other forms of art as well - video games, films, literature.

#### Tastebuilding

One of the core features that is coming very soon is the tastebuilder feature. We'll allow usersto take any aestheticized content and find similar content, thus, in theory, helping our users expand their tastes.
